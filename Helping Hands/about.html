                    <h3>Care</h3>
                    <p>Caring for people is one of the most recomended way of giving them a platform to make them feel worth and important. Most of people are emotionally crushed and they end up thinking that they are worthless and don't deserve any better opportunities to live their lives to its best.</p>

                    <h3>Listening</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes talking without been heard can really bring a person to a point of acting wronfully. So introducing a plartfom of communicating to most people who feel like they can't be heard, will bring many back to their senses to live the right way.</p>

                    <h1>Welcome to <mark>HELPING Hands</mark></h1>
                    <p>Helping Hands is an NPO that is based in the Township of Khayelitsha, We simply bring the startegy of minimizing crime and unemployment rate.<br>
                        Khayelithsa is the second lagest Township in South Africa, and about 90% of people who are living in Khayelithsa are from the small Villages situated in the Eastern Cape province because of hoping to find better oppotunities for a better living.<br>
                        The rate of crime & unemployment is very high in Khayelithsa. Due to a very high rate of unemployment in the Township, most of people are accepting any opportunity that comes to them (whether good or bad) as way of earning something for survival. In most cases there are no opportunities, now some people think of crime(Breakins, Robberies, Car highjaking etc) as a solution to their problem and result in the increasing of crime.</p>

                    <h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>
                    <p>Helping Hands exist to ignite the personal potential of a child or a young person who had to take different route because of not having a choice of living his/her best life.There's a say of <strong>"A problem child, is a child with a problem."</strong> We help to reach out to the main problems of the young people, so that we get an access in guiding them to their true being. We believe that no one can just wake up and think of making their lives a mess, Everyone wants to see themselves somewhere as better people in a better environment.</p>
